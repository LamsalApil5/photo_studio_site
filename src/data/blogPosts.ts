      <h2>Top 10 Wedding Photography Trends for 2025</h2>
      
      <p>The wedding photography landscape is constantly evolving, with new trends emerging each year. As we move through 2025, couples are seeking more authentic, creative, and personalized approaches to documenting their special day. Here are the top trends we're seeing this year:</p>
      
      <h3>1. Documentary-Style Storytelling</h3>
      
      <p>The journalistic approach continues to gain popularity as couples seek authentic, unposed moments. This style focuses on capturing the day as it unfolds naturally, preserving genuine emotions and spontaneous interactions.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Drone Photography & Videography</h3>
      
      <p>Aerial shots have become a must-have for modern weddings, offering breathtaking perspectives of venues and creative group shots that weren't possible before. The latest drones offer higher resolution and better stabilization than ever.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Film Photography Revival</h3>
      
      <p>There's been a notable resurgence in film photography, with many couples requesting at least some portions of their day to be shot on film. The timeless quality, distinctive grain, and rich colors of film create a nostalgic feel that digital sometimes can't replicate.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Artistic Night Photography</h3>
      
      <p>Advanced low-light capabilities in modern cameras have opened up creative possibilities for evening shots. Photographers are using creative lighting techniques to create magical nighttime portraits that stand out from the daytime coverage.</p>
      
      <h3>5. Inclusive Photography Approaches</h3>
      
      <p>Photographers are developing more inclusive practices that celebrate diversity in all its forms. This includes mastering lighting techniques for various skin tones and creating comfortable environments for all couples to express themselves authentically.</p>
      
      <h3>6. Nostalgic Film-Inspired Editing</h3>
      
      <p>Digital editing that mimics classic film stocks has become increasingly sophisticated. These styles add warmth, character, and a timeless quality to digital images.</p>
      
      <h3>7. AI-Enhanced Editing</h3>
      
      <p>Artificial intelligence tools are helping photographers deliver more consistent results more quickly. While the artistic direction comes from the photographer, AI assists with tasks like skin smoothing, sky replacement, and complex selections.</p>
      
      <h3>8. Minimalist, Editorial Approaches</h3>
      
      <p>Clean, magazine-worthy compositions with attention to light, shadow, and negative space are becoming more popular. This refined approach draws inspiration from fashion photography.</p>
      
      <h3>9. Photo-Video Hybrid Coverage</h3>
      
      <p>Many photographers now offer packages that include both still photography and motionâ€”from animated GIFs to short cinematic clips that complement the still images.</p>
      
      <h3>10. Virtual Reality Add-Ons</h3>
      
      <p>Cutting-edge photographers are beginning to offer 360-degree VR captures of key moments, allowing couples and guests who couldn't attend to experience the day in an immersive way.</p>
      
      <p>Which of these trends appeals to you most? We'd love to hear your thoughts and discuss how we might incorporate some of these approaches into your wedding photography.</p>
